# Automated-Withdrawal
# Scenario
Momentum Investments is seeking to automate the withdrawal
process for its investors. The process currently makes use of PDF
forms which investors must download, complete, sign and send to the
service area via e-mail. This is a time consuming exercise which
requires the service team to re-capture the withdrawal details from
the PDF form into the line of business system, and creates room for
service team to make mistakes. When volumes are high, this also
results in a bad experience for the investors where some of the
withdrawals are processed late. Having an automated process will
result in an improved investor experience and time saved for the
service area to focus on other important areas of the business.
The automated process should allow investors to select a product
they are withdrawing from, capture the withdrawal amount and
banking details the money must be paid into. Once the withdrawal is
completed, investors should receive a notification that shows them
the balance before the withdrawal was made, the amount withdrawn
and the closing balance.
